# Persell's Azure Resume

Hi everyone, this is my cloud resume challenge built in Azure. I utilized terraform to create the resource groups and resources in Azure for both the frontend and the backend. The static website is hosted on Azure blob storage and it is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
